    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe for stir-fried rice. Stir-fried rice
        involves first cooking whichever ingredients you want to complement the rice with,
        like protein, legumes, etc., and then stir-frying (preferably leftover) rice without
        together with the other ingredients.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <p>This is probably leftover rice, though recently-cooked rice can be used in a pinch.
